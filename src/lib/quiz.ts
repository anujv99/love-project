      "When I first started talking to you I had no idea that it would build into something so incredible, so powerful and so full of love. When I sent you the request I was honestly very sad due the psychologist situation. But I forced myself to sent you the request, I had no intention of even continuing looking for matches, but for some reason I did send you the request, and we talked a bit and you said how far Kota is, it was an unexpected response and I thought you were not interested, so I didn't text you and I was also sad due to the other thing, I felt a bit down and needed some time with my brother and travelling to take my mind off. Few days later and something strange happened, I didn't see your chat in my JS, I thought you had disconnected me, but I looked in recent chats and there it was, your name... I felt hopeful, I can't tell you how good I felt, I was afraid you had disconnected, but you didn't, so I texted you again. And since that day my life has turned upside down, every single day has become a memory which I can't forget, you are imprinted in my brain and my heart, and I just love you so much, I can't explain you how much I love you, there are no words to express such a strong feeling, you've made my life so much better. I can keep going but you have other questions to move on to, so this is it for here.",

I really like this line from this song "we can do anything if we put our mind to it", I really belive in these words just like I belive in us ðŸ˜€.`,

Your eyes hold the entire universe in them, I can keep looking into them for the rest of my life and never get tired of them, they are so big and deep and pretty. And your smile, I have no words for your smile, your smile has the power to pierce my heart and remove any worry, pain or suffering that I have. You keep saying that you are below average and don't look good, but try to see it from my eyes and you'll know how gorgeous you are, there is nothing better in this world my darling, you are the best.",

You have a magical voice that I haven't heard anytime before, when you sing for me I can't stop smiling, I never in my life thought that someone would sing for me, every time I hear your voice my heart fills with so many emotions that I can't explain, it feels like it will explode from all the emotions, I can't stop loving your voice.

I never in my life thought that anyone would love me, I am not that great, I'm fat, ugly, sound like a horse, I have blood pressure, I have anxiety issues, I have self doubt issues, I have so many problems, I always thought that no one would love me, why would someone compromise so much for me when I have nothing to give in return, why would someone settle for me when she can find someone with none of these issues, someone normal. But you changed that, you love me despite knowing all of me, and I love you for that. I can be what I am around you, I can do what I want around you, you made me feel safe and accepted me however I am, I know I'm not perfect, I'm so far from perfect, but despite that you love me, I have tears in my eyes as I'm writing this, I cannot tell you how much it means to me, I will give you the entire world because you have loved me, because you showed me that there is someone in this world who loves me, because you gave me the ability to love you, it's a wonderful feeling and I never want to lose you.",

In your heart I found safety and comfort, I don't feel afraid to talk to you, I don't feel like I have to change myself to be with you, I told you all my problems and you accepted them all, I have never found someone like you who is so caring, loving and understanding. You are not money minded, you don't put much value in materialistic things, you care more about love and these are the qualities that I adore in you. You have a beautiful heart Moni Ji, I have met a lot of people in my life, but I have never found someone with such a big heart as yours, you have a BOAT heart and I love you for that.",

I love you so much babe, I want to marry you and spend my entire life loving you and making you happy, happiness that I had forgotten until I met you, before I met you I spent days without smiling, I had no reason. But you came in like a storm and rained so hard on my heart, my heart was like a desert before I met you, there was not a single drop of happiness in it, I just numbed myself with endless work to forget about all my pains, but ever since you rained on me, the place which was once a desert, has now become a field full of trees, full of flowers, full of life and full of love. I can keep going but since time is running out, I'll stop here, there is one last thing after this, it's not a question, it's something different, but you'll have to wait until we meet to get the password. When we meet, I'll give you the password and you can see what's waiting for you, it's nothing special, but it's something I want to do for you. Enjoy this song, I Love You!",
