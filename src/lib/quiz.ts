      "When I first started talking to you I had no idea that it would build into something so incredible, so powerful and so full of love. When I sent you the request I was honestly very sad due the psychologist situation. But I forced myself to sent you the request, I had no intention of even continuing looking for matches, but for some reason I did send you the request, and we talked a bit and you said how far Kota is, it was an unexpected response and I thought you were not interested, so I didn't text you and I was also sad due to the other thing, I felt a bit down and needed some time with my brother and travelling to take my mind off. Few days later and something strange happened, I didn't see your chat in my JS, I thought you had disconnected me, but I looked in recent chats and there it was, your name... I felt hopeful, I can't tell you how good I felt, I was afraid you had disconnected, but you didn't, so I texted you again. And since that day my life has turned upside down, every single day has become a memory which I can't forget, you are imprinted in my brain and my heart, and I just love you so much, I can't explain you how much I love you, there are no words to express such a strong feeling, you've made my life so much better. I can keep going but you have other questions to move on to, so this is it for here.",

That's the first promise I made you, I know how much it hurts when someone ghost you, it only happened very breafly for me, but it was heart wrenching, I didn't knew what I did wrong. I don't ever want you to go through the same, that's why I promise to never ghost you in my life.",

Eastside was the first song I sent you and I sent it on JS, I sent this because you said you liked low volume songs (not the right word but I guess you know what I mean), and this song instantly clicked in my mind, and if I remember correctly you did like this song. I really like this line from this song "we can do anything if we put our mind to it", I really belive in these words just like I belive in us ðŸ˜€.`,
